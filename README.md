Implementation of the 2048 game like in [this reference](https://play2048.co/)

Rules:

- The game field is 4 x 4
- Each cell can be empty or contain one of the numbers: 2, 4, 8 ... 2^n
- The player can move cells with keyboard arrows
- All the numbers should be moved in the selected direction until all empty cells are filled in
- 2 equal cells should be merged into a doubled number
- The merged cell canâ€™t be merged twice during one move
- The move is possible if at least one cell is changed after the move
-  After move 2 or 4 appears in a random empty cell. 4 probability is 10%
- When 2048 value is displayed in any cell, win message should be shown.
- The game over message should be shown if there are no more available moves.
- Hide start message when game starts.
- Change the Start button to Restart after the first move.
- Increase score with each move. The score should be increased by the sum of all merged cells.
